rosjava is the first pure Java implementation of ROS.

From [ROS.org](http://www.ros.org/wiki/): _ROS is an open-source, meta-operating system for your robot. It provides the services you would expect from an operating system, including hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management._

Developed at Google in cooperation with Willow Garage, rosjava enables integration of Android and ROS compatible robots. This project is under active development and currently _alpha_ quality software. Please report bugs and feature requests on the [issues list](http://code.google.com/p/rosjava/issues/list).

To get started, visit the [rosjava\_core](http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/index.html) and [android\_core](http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/android_core/html/index.html) documentation.

Still have questions? Check out the ros-users [discussion list](https://code.ros.org/mailman/listinfo/ros-users), post questions to [ROS Answers](http://answers.ros.org/questions/) with the tag "rosjava," or join #ROS on irc.oftc.net.

rosjava was announced publicly during the Cloud Robotics tech talk at Google I/O 2011.
